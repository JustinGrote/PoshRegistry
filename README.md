#PoshRegistry

This is a powershell module to manipulate registry objects on either the local computer or a remote computer.
It is primarily a cmdlet wrapper for native Microsoft.Win32.RegistryKey function.

##Attributions
This is a derivative fork from the Remote Registry Powershell Module https://psremoteregistry.codeplex.com/ copyright 2011 Shay Levy, in compliance with the MS-PL license it was released under. My goal was to publish it to the Powershell Gallery for ease of access, and I attempted to contact Shay Levy multiple times about it with no response, so I received blessing from the Powershell Gallery team to publish a fork under a new name.

I removed the Author notes from the individual modules as the MS-PL states "This license does not grant you rights to use any contributors' name, logo, or trademarks.", however I am working hard to preserve the copyright notices where present and thank you to those who helped point out errors. My first and foremost issue was to get this great module into the Powershell Gallery and improve on it where I can. It is NOT my intention to steal Shay's code or pass it as my own, quite the opposite, I don't want people contacting Shay about this module since I'm owning this fork as per the MS-PL and don't want people under any impression that he maintains this fork of code that hasn't been updated since 2014. If Shay ever contacts me and wants the PoshRegistry gallery module for his own, I will give it to him gladly and have stated the same several times in that regard.
